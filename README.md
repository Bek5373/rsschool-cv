 ### Briefly About Myself:
 <pr> **CODES** have become a new alphabet for me. As I started to study programming, Internet pages began to form differently for me.
  
  I worked for 5 years in the field of television, in various private channels. I wanted to learn programming, but I thought that my mind was not enough. But as soon as I started working in this field, I realized that it is never too late to learn something new. The most interesting thing is that I graduated from secondary education in 2010, at the Lyceum, in the direction of the exact sciences, and received a miniprogrammer diploma. But I was not interested in this area in those days. After 12 years, looking back, I really wished that I did not continue my specialty.
